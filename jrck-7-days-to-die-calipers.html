Me and my friends have recently picked it up on the ps4 and have gotten pretty into it. We came across something that required calipers to make but every attempt to find them in game has been in vain. I tried to search for answers through Google but all I could find were posts that said they were removed from the game. We do have a recipe though that says it does require calipers so that's why we are confused. Any help would be greatly appreci.

I have my Nims certifications in vertical. UPDATE: Thanks for the suggestions and help! Seriously, this game has been a brutal chore all the way through. The main problem with this game is how fucking rare the calipers are. I searched eight towns container by container, 10 total Stiff Tools, and the entirety of central city. Not one caliper set. Not one. The whole point of the calipers is to be able to make bullets and use the guns you’ve been itching to use; when the game actually becomes fun.

Okay, I apologize in advance for this strange and about to be long post. When I was in High School a group of friends and I decided to break out the Ouija board and have a few laughs. We thought it wasn't real and were stupid kids. It was a store bought Parker Bros board. Anyway it was my friend, her older sister, their new neighbors (brothers) and myself.

Bit of a rant here, so bear with me, but this one's important. Like really important. Note: TL;DR - Read it anyway, it's worth it :-) There's a problem we have with leveling the bed amp axis's. Unless you got your printer yesterday you know bed leveling is super important to get a good print (or sometimes ANY print!). The problem is terminology. Words have meaning.

I lost 30lbs in about 16 weeks, not bad. I look and feel way better than before, but I've still got a bit of a gut so I want to lose 10 more pounds. I said that once I hit 165 I would start lifting and gaining mass, which I started last week.
