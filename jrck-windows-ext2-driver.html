Can I just boot live Puppy Linux or something into my netbook and copy ROMs to microSD card? My netbook has a microSD reader built in. All of this would be easier if just ONE person uploaded a microSD image with some ROMs in it. Even public domain/homebrew ones for each console. UPDATE: Never mind.

I have 1 NTFS partition for Windows, and the rest of partitions are EXT4. I want to change all the partitions to EXT3 to be able to use them between Linux and Windows. I heard that EXT3 partitions mount on Linux as EXT4 partitions, so I think that there is no difference between using EXT3 or EXT4 on Linux. Am I right.

Recently, I loaded Mint 18.2 on a 128GB USB using an ISO image, and am supposed to have a "persistent storage" of ~4GB (FAT32). I followed some instructions and made a casper-rw partition on the disk with an Ext2 file system. My home directory as well as my file system is stored on the FAT32 partition, and I am unable to use the Users and Groups application to change my home directory (the application won't open properly when accessed from root user), and I'm unsure if that would be effective.

I can use Ext2fsd to mount drives at boot, but it requires me to give it permission every time. In my situation, that is undesirable. Is there a native ext4 driver that makes Windows recognize Ext4 drives at kernel level? So that I only need to install the driver and not have to give it permission to mount my drives every.

So I have this NTFS partition that I share between Windows and Linux on my dual-booted computer. One day Windows started complaining that the directory is all derped up. I kept getting errors when trying to rename files. etc. So I ran chkdisk, and it seemed to repair whatever was wrong.

Hi all, wasn't sure if this was the correct subreddit or not but I'm hoping you guys can help me out. Right now, I've got a Core2Duo Macbook with 6GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD running the latest stable version of OS X (10.8.x). So, my only partition at this point is my HFS+ Journalized partition. I need to install Windows 7 or 8 to run Visual Studio 2012 for a programming class. Now, I know I can install it via Bootcamp, but I want to do it right. As in, I want to be able to share my data betwe. 
I'd like to be able to access my the hard drive I use for Ubuntu. I have purchased a Micro USB to USB adapter (came in a kit with a male/male cable, so I can plug any USB cable into the adapter), and am wondering about a driver/app/something that would allow Android to read external media like a USB hard drive or flash drive. Does anything like this exist? I have a Samsung Infuse. Hi people, I have a question. I have Win7 and openSUSE installed in my computer. One NTFS partition for Win7, one ext4 partition for root and another one for /home (and the swap one, of course). I'm going to reinstall openSUSE, and I want to rearrange the partitions. This is what I want: One partition for Win7. One partition for openSUSE. One shared partition. I want /home to be here. I need to read and write in this partition in both Windows and openSUSE. My first thought A year ago, I switched full time to Linux though I still boot macOS and Windows from time to time. The lack of support for competing disk formats is shocking in today's connected world. Mac won't even see ext4 and helpfully offers to reformat the partition. It also can't write to NTFS. Windows won't read or write to either HFS or ext4. Of course, Linux handles them all, including writing to HFS+ if you want to assume a little risk. Should I really have to dish out a few hundred bucks Hi everybody, as you can tell from the title, I am unwillingly running two bootloaders, namely `rEFInd` (being "higher up" in the hierarchy) and `grub`. Why is that? My laptop is a MacBook Pro, which I wanted to dual boot Archlinux and OSX with¹ Anyway. I followed some tutorials, which would usually suggest using `rEFInd` a bootloader when wanting to run anything other than OSX and Windows (which can be installed with `Bootcamp`). So I did that. Then I had a very hard time installing.

A couple weeks ago, I did a big update to my Debian stable Lenovo T470p and rebooted for the first time in 90 days. `Error: unknown filesystem` I'm pretty sure grub knows about ext4, but maybe it's something else. So here's what I couldn't do: Boot into the rescue initramfs because it can't find it, it's on that filesystem Make a rescue USB. I don't have a computer which to make one with Boot the preinstalled windows that I have never used, because it forgot how to boot up since I insta.

I'm using 18.04, 64 bit. the only problem I have ever had is that pop os doesn't always like to shut down properly.

I have a new 3TB hard drive. I formatted it with FFS. Incidentally, I just formatted the whole device as a superfloppy with no partition table, because I have no plans to use it as anything other than a whole drive. Just newfs /dev/rsd2c. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, is there? Anyway, my idea was that I would use the drive like normal in OpenBSD, then make use of the Linux kernel's read-only UFS2 driver to mount in Ubuntu. So I put a few large files (6GB+) onto the hard drive. Microsoft will terminate support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025.
